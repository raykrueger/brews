          <h2>Brown Sugar Mustgo</h2>
          <p>
            This is a totally made up recipe. It is based on what I had leftover from other brew's and the fact that my wife
            bought too much brown sugar for making christmas cookies. Fun thing here is that my local homebrew shop did not carry
            brown malt. So I bought 1lb of Maris Otter and roasted it in the oven at 350&deg; for 1 hour.
          </p>
          <p>OG: Should be around 1.084 according to Beer Tools.</p>

          <h2>Brew Day 01-02-2011</h2>
          <h3>Mash</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Nailed my mash in temp of 154&deg; and the temp is holding strong.</li>
              <li>Pre-boil gravity is 1.020, around 61% efficiency which is shitty.</li>
              <li>Post boil gravity (including brown sugar) is 1.056, well short of what the calculations called for.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Boil</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Nothing eventful to report here. Other than getting burned a few times trying to get the 2lb bag of dark brown sugar
                into the kettle.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall brew day went well. I think my efficiency problems are due to a lack of stirring. I only bothered to stir
            the mash like once in the hour it was resting. I was focused on not messing with the mash and maintaining temp and
            avoided opening the tun too much. Now that I know my heat can remain steady I'll stir a lot more next time.

          <h2>Taste and Measure 01-15-2011</h2>
          <h3>Measurement Drama</h3>
          <p>
            First discovery is that my hydrometer is a piece of shit. It was way way off, and pushing my measurements way down.
            After reacalibrating it my final gravity came in at 1.010. With how far off my hydrometer was I'm going to say my OG
            was probably more like 1.066, not 1.056.
          </p>
          <h3>Tasting</h3>
          <p>
            Wow. I'm not going to lie. This beer is crazy delicious right now. It has a great Brown Ale taste, with a silky
            smooth mouthfeel. I get a pretty insane peanut butter finish. This is going to be a tasty beer indeed. Contemplating
            oaking half this thing to see what happens.
