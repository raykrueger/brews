              Here you will find my notes on my most recent recipes and how they've turned out. I use
              <a href="http://www.beertools.com/" target="_blank">Beer Tools</a>
              for the Mac to dig into the science and numbers. Unfortunately that doesn't give me a real nice way to record things that
              happen during the process (mistakes), gravity measurements along the way, and notes on anything and everything else.

              Incidentally this is also a bit of a technology expirement. I'm currently building out this using mostly static
              content. The content is generated using
              <a href="http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org/">Staticmatic</a>
              which allows me to build out the html using Haml which is way nicer to use than html directly. Each of the recipes
              is essentially just a page in the app that I'll layout using partials for the common elements.
              In this expirement I'm essentially forgoing a database and all the other overhead since it's easy enough for me to edit
              the content directly and just push it out to a site. You can check out the source at
              <a href="https://github.com/raykrueger/brews">Github</a>.

              The layout of the site should also work well with mobile displays such as iPhones and Android devices. A lesser device
              (Blackberry) may not look as hot though. If you're using IE, you can go to hell. I really don't care if it works for
              you at all.
